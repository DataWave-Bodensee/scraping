June 20th is World Refugee Day. First observed in 2001, it commemorates the 50th anniversary of what was originally known as Africa Refugee Day. Today, it honors the courage and resilience of the world’s refugees.

CDC’s Role in Refugee Health

CDC partners with agencies, governments, and organizations to promote and improve the health of immigrants, US-bound refugees, and migrants globally. CDC’s Division of Global Migration Health (DGMH) oversees the required medical examination of refugee and immigrant visa applicants, and promotes preventive treatments for and vaccination of refugees for several communicable diseases before departure to the United States.

Refugees may not be fully protected against certain infectious diseases due to lack of access to national vaccination services. For years, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and polio, impacted the refugee resettlement process leading to long travel delays and disease spread. These outbreaks often caused a halt in the resettlement process until spread of disease in the refugee population was controlled. Since 2013, CDC has partnered with the Department of State Bureau of Populations, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to implement a vaccination program for US-bound refugees overseas before resettlement. Since then, more than 400,000 refugees have received vaccinations, preventing outbreaks that can cause illness as well as delays in resettlement. Additionally, DGMH’s field programs in Nairobi, Kenya, and Bangkok, Thailand work within their regions to improve their ability to detect and to reduce spread of diseases in refugee camps. CDC also works with experts in refugee health to provide guidance for the domestic refugee medical examination recommended once newly arrived refugees reach their final destinations.

Public Health Emergency Response

When CDC activated its emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC worked to protect the health of travelers and reduce the risk of spreading the disease associated with rapid global travel. CDC developed communication materials tailored to refugee, immigrants, and migrant (RIM) communities in the United States and engaged with partners and organizations working in those communities to disseminate these culturally appropriate materials.

Following the fall of Kabul, the United States evacuated more than 70,000 Afghans to “Safe Havens” (military bases and a hotel convention center) in the United States as part of Operation Allies Welcome. At these Safe Havens, CDC provided oversight and medical support to Afghans receiving COVID-19 testing and the required medical examination for immigration, which included vaccinations. CDC also worked to ensure that information from the medical examinations was routed to receiving health departments at the Afghans’ final destinations to ensure proper follow-up of certain conditions, such as tuberculosis. This also ensured continuity of care for the recommended domestic refugee medical examination. Additionally, CDC provided several resources in multiple languages to Afghans, as well as resources to partners and guidance to laboratories assisting with Operation Allies Welcome.

Partnerships Ensuring Continuum of Care

After arrival, refugees receive assistance with housing and healthcare coverage for 12 months. CDC continues to work with partners to develop and distribute health education and communication materials that are culturally and linguistically appropriate for refugees. CDC funds The National Resource Center for Refugees, Immigrants, and Migrants (NRC-RIM), which supports health departments and community organizations working with RIM communities. Since 2020, NRC-RIM launched several health communication products translated in as many as 44 languages. Through partnerships, refugees connect with domestic resources to ensure a continuum of care enabling them to live healthy, active, and productive lives in their new communities."
1,Rabat Declaration adopted to improve refugee and migrant health - World Health Organization (WHO),https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndoby5pbnQvbmV3cy9pdGVtLzE2LTA2LTIwMjMtcmFiYXQtZGVjbGFyYXRpb24tYWRvcHRlZC10by1pbXByb3ZlLXJlZnVnZWUtYW5kLW1pZ3JhbnQtaGVhbHRo0gEA?oc=5,"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT","Ministers and government representatives adopted a groundbreaking political declaration, the Rabat Declaration, to strengthen the global commitment to improve the health of refugees and migrants.

The Rabat Declaration was adopted during the high-level segment of the Third Global Consultation on the Health of Refugees and Migrants that took place on 13–15 June 2023 (1). The event, co-hosted by the Kingdom of Morocco, the World Health Organization (WHO), IOM, the UN Migration Agency, and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, was attended by government representatives from 50 United Nations Member States and observers as well as representatives from humanitarian organizations, civil society and refugee and migrant communities and UN agencies.

The meeting aimed to promote the inclusion of refugees and migrants in national health systems as part of the global movement for universal health coverage, and work towards resilient and sustainable health emergency prevention, preparedness and response capacities.

One in eight people globally is either a migrant or is forcibly displaced by factors including conflict, persecution, environmental degradation, or the lack of human security and opportunity.

Taking stock of the progress achieved in refugee and migrant health and considering the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, the countries supporting the Rabat Declaration committed to:

accelerate efforts to improve the health of refugees, migrants and their host communities;

address the root causes that negatively influence their health; and

work towards including health and social protection considerations in national policies related to refugees and migrants.

The declaration also reaffirms the right of every human being, including refugees and migrants, to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.

Recognition of professional health certifications, enhancing information and communication channels to counter misperceptions and misinformation, ensuring safe working environments for refugees and migrants as well as investing in inclusive and appropriate data systems and high-quality global research are highlighted in the declaration as key to advancing towards the goals.

Countries supporting it commit to including refugee and migrant populations and their host communities in policies and plans for prevention, preparedness, response and recovery to pandemics and other public health emergencies, while strengthening international and cross-border collaboration.

Stakeholders also pledge to foster inclusive financing mechanisms to reduce budget pressures on national systems and promote the meaningful participation of refugees and migrants in health policy discussions to identify and design appropriate interventions for their health needs.

Quotes from officials:

“The holding of this meeting in the Kingdom of Morocco supports the tireless efforts of our country for social justice, believing that health is a fundamental right for all, including migrants and refugees. In this context, the phenomenon of migration and asylum has always been an integral part of the history of the Kingdom of Morocco, as Morocco is considered a point of intersection between Africa, Europe and the Middle East, and is seen as a transit point, a receiving country and a safe haven for anyone who requests it.”

Khalid Ait Taleb, Minister of Health and Social Protection, Kingdom of Morocco

“Refugees and migrants face significant threats to health, and significant barriers to accessing the health services they need. Protecting the health and dignity of refugees and migrants during their often-dangerous journeys, and in the countries hosting them, is a matter of human rights, and human decency. Because health for all means all, including refugees and migrants.”

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organization

“Our ultimate goal for this consultation is to promote the appropriate interventions that improve, protect and preserve the health and well-being of all refugees and migrants, and host communities. This goal cannot be realized without political commitment and a whole-of-government approach. And this means involving representatives from the ministries of health, finance, foreign affairs, interior, planning and other senior officials.”

Ahmed Al-Mandhari, Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, World Health Organization

""Member States today have pledged that no one will be left behind when addressing the health needs of those forcibly displaced. Their commitment to not only include refugees, migrants and their hosting communities in national health policies and plans but, to also include them meaningfully in policy health discussions is a significant momentum towards universal health coverage and worthy of global support.""

Raouf Mazou, UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner Operations

“IOM is encouraged by the Rabat Declaration, outlining comprehensive commitments for promoting the health of refugees and migrants. This consultation will be a milestone embodying the political commitment of governments to enhancing global collaboration and mutual support to improve the health of migrants and refugees, and to inform upcoming high-level health and migration meetings and forums.”

Othman Belbeisi, IOM MENA Regional Director

2,The Toll of Early Marriage and Motherhood in Zaatari Refugee Camp - Wilson Center,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbHNvbmNlbnRlci5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS90b2xsLWVhcmx5LW1hcnJpYWdlLWFuZC1tb3RoZXJob29kLXphYXRhcmktcmVmdWdlZS1jYW1w0gEA?oc=5,"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT","In the heart of Jordan’s Zaatari Refugee Camp, Souad, a 20-year-old expectant mother, eagerly awaits the arrival of her baby. But amid the anticipation, Souad carries a heavy burden of fear that her child’s life will be fraught with hardships. “Raising a child in the camp is difficult. There’s limited access to essential resources such as clothing and baby milk formula,” she said.

Souad’s mixed emotions reflect the struggles of thousands of Syrian mothers in Zaatari Camp, located about 12 kilometers from the Syrian border and home to about 82,000 people. More than half of Zaatari’s population are children, and 1 in 4 are women of reproductive age. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), an estimated 2,300 women and girls in Zaatari are currently pregnant.

Limited resources

But raising children in the camp is not easy. In Zaatari and nearby Azraq camp—the two largest Syrian camps in Jordan—families survive on a monthly stipend of only $32. Malnutrition and food insecurity afflict nearly 90 percent of Syrians in Jordan; the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says “only 2 percent of refugee households can meet their essential food needs.” Despite this, the camp sees an average of 80-100 births per week, and approximately one of every ten births to Syrian refugee mothers is to a child.

“Raising children is important,” says 34-year-old Raghda, who has raised five children in Zaatari. “But this was not the life I wanted for them.”

Early marriage and early motherhood often go hand in hand, perpetuating a cycle where younger brides have more children.

The struggle for a better life often leads girls to marry young. Nearly 2 in 5 girls in Zaatari are married before their 18th birthday, almost double the global average. Zaatari has witnessed a near 12% surge in child marriages since 2019; UNFPA has already documented at least 321 underage marriages in the camp this year alone, with some brides as young as 12. Early marriage and early motherhood often go hand in hand, perpetuating a cycle where younger brides have more children.

“The population of the camp is increasing. Education is very limited. Most girls in Zaatari won’t finish their education because there are limited opportunities,” says Abeer Shraiteh, an Emergency Field Officer at UNFPA in Jordan. “It’s a challenging life in the camp, so families will look for any opportunities. Many see child marriage as one of the only options for their daughters.”

Education for Girls

26-year-old Lamees married at seventeen and has five children—all are below age 10 and have never known life outside the camp. “It was a good feeling the first time I discovered I was pregnant,” Lamees says. “But after I delivered my first baby, I started to feel what it means to be responsible for raising her, protecting her from sickness and dust, and living in this atmosphere in the camp.” Because Lamees only holds a seventh-grade education, she finds it especially hard to educate her children. “I find it difficult to teach my children because I am uneducated. It’s a problem.”

Access to education remains an uphill battle for refugee girls. Globally, more than 130 million girls between the ages of 6 and 17 are out of school, and refugee girls are 2.5 times likelier to be out of school than boys. But studies show that education has a direct correlation with delaying marriage, pregnancy, and childbirth. Conversely, girls with little or no education are three times more likely to marry by 18 than those with secondary or higher education. In Jordan, nearly 90 percent of Syrian refugees are enrolled in primary school. This drops to 25-30 percent enrollment in secondary school meaning almost 70 percent of refugee children are not in school after age 13 or 14.

“In 2023, we can’t say that a girl’s right to education has been fulfilled if she doesn’t even get the chance to finish secondary school,” says Bill Van Esveld, a children’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “But enrollment plummets as refugee kids should be moving from primary to secondary, and in Jordan, we found that refugee girls are hit with a variety of harms and obstacles, including child marriage.”

Mr. Van Esvel said addressing the root causes, such as poverty and labor exploitation of refugee parents, is critical to ensuring more girls stay in school. “Jordan can do more to enforce its laws that make lower secondary education compulsory for all. It should cancel policies that block kids who were out of school for three years from returning. And for real change to take off, it’s key to improve the quality of education and stop suppressing demand; lift barriers to higher education and to entering certain professions. After a dozen years of atrocities, Syria is still not safe for returnees, and education is the sine qua non for refugee girls to realize their rights.”

Some organizations in the camp, like UNFPA, have successfully implemented family planning strategies, providing short-term and long-term care for postpartum mothers. To date, there have been zero maternal deaths in Zaatari. But Ms. Shraiteh warned the current trends of increasing child marriages and birth rates in the camp should raise alarm bells. “If a girl gets married young and has children young, it means she will never think about her dreams or future,” she says.

The long-term consequences [of early marriage] are felt by entire communities as generations of girls are denied the opportunity to reach their full potential.

Substantial research and data consistently show that the toll of early marriage and motherhood extends far beyond individual girls and their families. The long-term consequences are felt by entire communities as generations of girls are denied the opportunity to reach their full potential. When a girl feels a lack of agency and limited prospects for her future, it can contribute to a sense of hopelessness and the perception that early motherhood is the only viable path.

Addressing Root Causes

Addressing early marriage and motherhood in Zaatari requires a multi-faceted approach. Access to education is essential; it equips girls with the knowledge and skills needed to make informed choices about their livelihoods and futures. Comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education in school curricula would provide girls with the information they need to make informed decisions about their health and bodies.

Improving the socioeconomic conditions of refugee families is also crucial. This requires providing parents with economic opportunities and livelihood support to ensure they can support their families without resorting to marrying off their daughters. NGOs and humanitarian organizations working in Zaatari must collaborate with local communities to challenge sociocultural norms and practices that limit girls' opportunities for education and personal development. Community dialogues and engagement with religious and community leaders can be key in shifting attitudes and creating an environment where girls' rights are respected and protected.

Ultimately, investing in the education and health of young refugee women and girls is not only a matter of individual rights but also about building stronger communities in which everyone benefits, creating ripple effects for generations to come.

3,UNHCR and IOM call for decisive action following Mediterranean tragedy - UNHCR,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaGNyLm9yZy9uZXdzL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3VuaGNyLWFuZC1pb20tY2FsbC1kZWNpc2l2ZS1hY3Rpb24tZm9sbG93aW5nLW1lZGl0ZXJyYW5lYW4tdHJhZ2VkedIBAA?oc=5,"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT","UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) are calling for urgent and decisive action to prevent further deaths at sea following the latest tragedy in the Mediterranean, the worst in several years.

While the number of people onboard the boat, which capsized on 14 June off the coast of Greece, is not clear, it is believed to have been somewhere between 400 and 750, according to various testimonies. So far 104 people have been rescued and 78 bodies retrieved, while hundreds remain missing and feared dead.

The boat was reportedly in distress since the morning of 13 June. A large-scale search and rescue operation was announced by the Hellenic Coast Guard on the morning of 14 June, after the boat capsized.

The duty to rescue people in distress at sea without delay is a fundamental rule of international maritime law. Both shipmasters and States have an obligation to render assistance to those in distress at sea regardless of their nationality, status or the circumstances in which they are found, including on unseaworthy vessels, and irrespective of the intentions of those onboard.

Any action carried out with regard to search and rescue should be conducted in a manner consistent with the obligation to prevent loss of life at sea.

UNHCR and IOM welcome the investigations that have been ordered in Greece into the circumstances which eventually led to the boat capsizing and the loss of so many lives.

Both UNHCR and IOM have been on the ground in Kalamata in southern Greece in close coordination with the authorities providing support and assistance to the survivors including non-food items, hygiene kits, interpretation services and counselling for survivors who are traumatized following the ordeal.

UNHCR and IOM reiterate that search and rescue at sea is a legal and humanitarian imperative.

“The EU must put safety and solidarity at the heart of its action in the Mediterranean. In view of the increased movements of refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean, collective efforts, including greater coordination between all Mediterranean States, solidarity, and responsibility-sharing, as reflected in the EU’s Pact on Migration and Asylum are essential to save lives. This includes the establishment of an agreed regional disembarkation and redistribution mechanism for people who arrive by sea, which we continue to advocate for,” said Gillian Triggs, UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner for Protection.

“It is clear that the current approach to the Mediterranean is unworkable. Year after year, it continues to be the most dangerous migration route in the world, with the highest fatality rate. States need to come together and address the gaps in proactive search and rescue, quick disembarkation, and safe regular pathways. These collective efforts should have the human rights of migrants and saving lives at the centre of any response” said Federico Soda, IOM Director for the Department of Emergencies.

The refugee crisis was exacerbated by monsoon flooding, which destroyed much of that year's harvest.

Cholera, dysentery, malaria, plague, small-pox, typhoid and typhus were all widespread, adding to the suffering.

Refugee camps were established across the Indian sub-continent with the largest emerging in Lahore and Delhi.

Help across borders

The British Red Cross was working throughout South Asia long before 1947.

As violence spread across the Indian sub-continent, the Red Cross received requests for medical assistance and equipment from both India and Pakistan.

The Pakistan government sought nurses and doctors for field hospitals, while the Indian government, through the Indian Red Cross, appealed for medical supplies and other emergency items.

Both countries asked the Red Cross for immediate supplies of blood, plasma and sulpha drugs to combat cholera and dysentery epidemics, as well as penicillin for septic conditions and vitamins for malnutrition.

While remaining neutral and independent, the Red Cross did what it could to ease the suffering of the millions of refugees across both countries.

The British Red Cross spent £20,000 of its own funds: the equivalent of around £500,000 today – to supply the requested items and divided them up equally between the two countries.

A Red Cross hospital was established in Lahore with a 400-bed capacity.

At the same time, £25,000 – the equivalent of around £700,000 today – was donated to the Indian Red Cross, along with 12 ambulances and other medical equipment.

In the UK, the Red Cross initiated a drive to recruit medical and administrative staff, giving priority to those who had already served in India with experience of the customs, people and languages."
